    "If you wanted to develop an application that provided the user with an extended conversation experience, your application would capture the history of user prompts and model responses; for every new user prompt, your application would bundle the (growing) conversation history in precisely the way done above for the \"few-shot\" example. The pieces and the syntax are the same, but the history of prompts & responses would be dynamically generated by your app's user and the LLM, and the conversation history would be managed by your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important: the LLM itself has no \"memory\" and can never store a conversation. It takes an application to do store and manage conversations. In many contemporary examples, each new user imput to an extended-conversation chatbot app results in a wholesale from-the-beginning processing of the historical conversation. There are frameworks that let your app cache the \"tokenized\" version of your conversation history, so that the LLM does not have to freshly encode the history with each subsequent prompt, but these are not ubiquitous."

    "\n",
    "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a technique intended to \"quietly\" bundle records from an application-specific data set (PDFs? Database? Text files? Spreadsheets? A mix?) alongside a user's submission. Your RAG application must select a few data records related to the user's submission, and then bundle these records with the user submission to craft the _actual_ prompt that will be sent to the LLM; the _actual_ prompt is typically never revealed to the user in most applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an approach you may use if your application is meant to help the user with exploring documentation, a book, a database, or some other source of text of your choosing as the application developer -- or your application may even accept data sources (such as PDFs or spreadsheets) from the user, if your application is designed to help the user \"discuss\" their own documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A real trick with developing a successful RAG application is the developer's method of selecting the records from the data source that are most-relevant to each and every user submission (\"question\").\n",
    "\n",
    "You then have your application prompt the LLM with something like, \"Please answser this user's question question that follows, but also be informed by these several pieces of related data from our private data store: ...\" rather than having the user interact directly with the LLM. You generally return to the user the response that was provided by the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user may feel like the LLM has \"read the documentation\" or \"studied the book,\" but your application is simply doing a pre-**Generation** step of **Augmenting** the users's query with some data that your application **Retrieved** from your data store; hence the name **Retrieval Augmented Generation**."
